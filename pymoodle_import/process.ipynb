      "Here are several suggestions to make it work for you: First, make sure you meet initially in person. Hybrid doesn't mean 100% online. A lot of people get that wrong.

      "Third, See something; say something. If the individual you’re mentoring does something fantastic that impresses you, or you hear a colleague, client or customer say something positive about his or her work, send a personal note congratulating them.
