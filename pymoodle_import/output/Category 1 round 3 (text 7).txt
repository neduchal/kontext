NZ’s cyber security centre warns more attacks likely following stock market outages 



The Government Communications Security Bureau has  to all New Zealand businesses to be prepared for cyber-attacks, after almost a week of  on the New Zealand stock exchange (NZX). The attacks are part of worldwide hateful cyber activity and sometimes the NZX’s website service w{3:SHORTANSWER:%100%as#~%100%was#} unavailable for hours. 

The type of attack is known as a Distributed Denial of Service (). The attacker infects large numbers, often thousands or even millions, of computers with a virus that allows the attacker to instruct the infected computer — known as a “bot” — to send thousands of requests for data to the target.

This is normally done by firewalls at the level of each computer or the internet service provider or, as in the case of New Zealand, at a country’s electronic border.

The COVID-19 pandemic means millions of people are working from home around the world, outside their normal corporate security, often using the family computer. Some people may be less careful about downloading software, particularly on illegal streaming sites, and may be using free or unsecured wifi networks.
